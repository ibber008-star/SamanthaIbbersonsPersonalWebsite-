			<h2>ALLETE / Minnesota Power (Duluth)</h2>
			<p>One business I want to work for is ALLETE. They are a part of Minnesota Power and are located in Duluth, Minnesota. They offer internships in Communications, Marketing, and Business. I think I would excel in creating social media content and promoting employee engagement. I also love to volunteer, and they give opportunities to do that. I am qualified because I am a Communications major, have a lot of experience in marketing, volunteering, starting a business, and I love to learn new things and be a part of new communities!</p>

			<h2>UnitedHealth Group (Eden Prairie)</h2>
			<p>Another business I am particularly interested in is UnitedHealth Group. The office I would be working out of would be in Eden Prairie, and it is hybrid — four days in the office, one day remote. I think this could be an amazing opportunity for me. I believe I am qualified because of my sales experience working for Vector Marketing, my strong communication skills, and my incentive to sell, make money, and learn more about something I am passionate about. I am great with people and did exceptionally well when I worked for Vector. I am excited about applying for this internship because they seem like a well-rounded company that treats employees well and truly wants to help my development in my career.</p>
